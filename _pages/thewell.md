This is the quiet place where I return to what I once passed but never mastered.
I come back not to regret, but to deepen.
I clean what was murky, I draw again what I failed to drink.
I do not move fast. I learn again, slowly.









井

我来过这里，喝过浊水，  
如今我愿自己伏下，  
把井渫净，  
再汲一瓢清。

I have been here before, and drank murky water.  
Now, I choose to kneel,  
clean the well with my own hands,  
and draw one clear ladle again.
